# Me & My Blog ðŸ‘‹

So for those that do not know me, I am Chris Sidebotham, I am based in the UK and I have been around the Managed Service Provider (MSP) industry for most of my career, from IT Support to Project Consultancy. 

This blog is a place for me to brain dump everything that I know and wish to write about. Over the course of my career I have come across many new technologies and spent hours searching the internet for bug fixes and resolutions! So this is me giving something back!
