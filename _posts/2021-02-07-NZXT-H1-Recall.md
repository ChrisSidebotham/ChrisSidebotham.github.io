Do you have an NZXT H1 Case? If so, make sure you read this post! If you are not aware, NZXT created the H1 Case design with a single flaw.... its a fire hazard. 

The fire hazard is caused by two screws that attach to the PCIe riser assembly, depending on how the screws have been placed, this can expose a 12v plane that can cause an electrical short that can lead to a fire. The resolution to this issue was to replace the metal screws with nylon ones.

The H1 case from NZXT was recalled on December 22, 2020, following safety concerns. NZXT later made the case available for purchase again with Nylon Screws. Unfortunately, the nylon screws still caused issues, slowly wearing away the PCB and rendering the case a major fire hazard for anyone who decides to sell it in the future. Now, NZXT is removing the H1 case from its store and sending out redesigned PCIe Gen3 riser assemblies to anyone with a current H1 case. The company also commits to a "more robust and thorough design processes" going forward.

NZXT's response to this issue has been met with criticism from customers and the media. [Gamers Nexus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XIKOSrQdQ0) posted a video on January 31, 2021, that goes over the risks of the NZXT H1 case. NZXT have since given thanks to Gamer Nexus for drawing attention to such a large safety concern. 

So, If you have a NZXT H1, make sure you get a temporary case and contact NZXT to get a recall!
