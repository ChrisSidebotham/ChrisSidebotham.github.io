March 2021 has arrived and which means another round of Microsoft Ignite has come and passed all too fast! Once again Microsoft has hosted a fully digital Ignite. However, Microsoft Ignite did not disappoint in delivering announcements, features and amazing content! For this post, I wanted to wrap up my top picks from the latest announcements at Ignite. But don‚Äôt worry, if you want to check out all the new feature yourself, head over to the [Microsoft Ignite Book of News!](https://news.microsoft.com/ignite-march-2021-book-of-news/?_lrsc=9e87c11a-b95f-4035-8e10-a54ad7442a35)

## Azure Resource Mover 
Microsoft has announced General Availability of Azure Resource Mover, A global service to assist with moving Azure resources across regions and availability zones. As the Azure platform grows Azure Resource Mover means IT Admins no longer have to spend countless hours exporting templates, configuring recovery services or recreating solutions to leverage the new expansion. Azure Resource Mover has been in preview since Ignite last year and has been heavily adopted by customers to drive feedback and deliver improvements like dependency analysis to ensure a successful move!

In September 2020 Microsoft announced the preview of Azure communication Services, a service that became the first fully managed communication platform integrating with Microsoft Teams to enable internal and external communications. Paired with Azure Bot Service‚Äôs new telephony channel and Azure Cognitive Services, Azure communication services can provide powerful artificial intelligence and natural language via a traditional phone line compared to other standard IVR offerings.

## Azure Automanage - Preview
Another capability for the 2021 Azure preview is Azure Automanage, Automanage brings the power of ‚Äòpoint, click, set, forget‚Äô to virtual machines. Azure Automanage eliminates the requirement of spending time ensuring Azure best practices are met, Services such as Azure Update Management, Azure Backup and VM Insights can now be configured by Azure Automanage. Automanage can be deployed to Azure Resources by the use of Azure Policy, meaning all best practices are achieved shortly after deployment. With monitoring and remediation for drift, Azure customers can sleep well at night knowing they‚Äôre business-critical virtual machines are protected!

## Azure Route Server 
Another exciting update for Azure Networking enthusiasts is Azure Route Server. With this new offering from Microsoft, Networking Administrators no longer need to update User-Defined Routes when NVA‚Äôs announce new routes or updating your route table when you update your virtual networks addresses. The new offering also has direct support for your existing  ExpressRoute and Azure VPN configurations without the need to configure or manage BGP Peerings between your gateway and Azure Route Server.

## Azure Monitor for Windows Virtual Desktop
Azure Monitor has been a single pane of glass experience for administrators and champions to monitor the health of resources, network and applications. Microsoft has announced that Azure Monitor for Windows Virtual Desktop will become generally available in the next few weeks. Azure Monitor‚Äôs capabilities will provide a centralized view of Azure alerts, Agent errors, Host warnings and health thresholds.

Continuing with the Power Platform theme, Power Automate desktop was introduced in 2020 and provides low-code RPA capabilities for synchronizing files, getting notifications and much more.

## Microsoft Power Fx 
Gone are the days of VBA! üéâ 
With rumours coming out for the woodwork a month or two ago, Power Fx was leaked with the slogan ‚ÄòThink VBA‚Äô. Microsoft Power Fx is the first low-code language to be published for logic customisation across the Power Platform. Power Fx is the heart of Canvas Apps and while the language may be available now, Microsoft is working hard to integrate with Power Virtual Agents, Microsoft Dataverse and Model-Driven Apps. Low-code enables development from ‚Äúno-code‚Äù to ‚ÄúPro-Code‚Äù with no setbacks in-between.

## Universal Print
Universal Print has been an eagerly awaited announcement for many since the initial preview announcement back in July 2020. Microsoft has now announced that Universal Print is now generally available to enterprise, education & business licensed customers (Although the Azure Team may have forgotten to remove the ‚Äòpreview‚Äô tag in Azure). Universal Print is a modern cloud-based & serverless print solution that allows organisations to leverage the ability to manage and maintain a simple and secure print solution via Microsoft Cloud Services. Microsoft has been working with existing manufacturers such as HP, Canon, Brother and Lexmark to deliver updates for ‚Äòout-of-the-box. Non-compatible printers can still be deployed with the use of the Universal Print connector Software, allowing fully centralized print management direct from the Azure Console!

## Attack Simulation Training 
There is no doubt Cyber Security is a high priority for all organisations. General availability for Attack Simulation Training began in January and was officially announced at Ignite. Wrapped up in Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Attack Simulation training provides detection, prioritisation, and remediation of threat scenarios, using neutralised versions of real attacks to simulate the uphill battle against the continuously changing attacker.

## AWS Single Sign-on from Azure AD App Gallery 
This is definitely a top pick for me, having been involved in many multi-cloud scenarios, AWS SSO provides simple SSO access across multiple AWS accounts and resources such as the AWS Console, Command Line Interface and AWS SSO integrated applications. Microsoft announced that AWS SSO is now pre-integrated in the Azure AD App Gallery to allow the customer to quickly configure and deploy the means to leverage SSO and User Provisioning into AWS directly from Azure AD!
