In a world where millions of people are working from home, keeping in touch can be difficult! Over the last few years Microsoft Teams has adapted and evolved into one of the largest all-in-one collaboration platforms. Teams isn't about moving to a new application, it's about enhancing and improving the way we all work within the Microsoft 365.

But if you asked me what my favorite features of Microsof Teams is i'd probably give you a list like this:

* Modern communication, Using GIF's and media couldn't be easier and much better than your standard "Hi, How are you?"
* All messages can be edited or deleted so those which are prone to typo's and even provides instant feedback for everyone in the conversation!
* Easy Third-party integreations, with apps like Stack Overflow, Polly and Trello (Sorry Microsoft Planner)
* Conferencing and last minute meetings couldn't be easier with 3rd parties and even the virtual quiz nights!
* Each Channel has an email address allowing people to organize communications, keep track of email replies and announcement without complex mailing rules
