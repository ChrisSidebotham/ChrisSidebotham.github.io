So you have your Github page ready to go, but you want to use a custom domain, this can be a struggle for any beginner user. So I have written this guide about how you can use a custom domain in your Github page and integrate with Cloudflare. All of these services have free tiers to utilise. So, Let's get started!  

## Get a Domain

You need a domain to attach. Buy a domain from any from your favourite registrar but make sure it supports a custom nameserver.

## Set custom nameserver

Your domain needs to point to the Cloudflare server. So, you need to update the nameserver of your domainâ€™s default to below two and make sure the other nameserverâ€™s field remains empty without the first two.

```
gail.ns.cloudflare.com
phil.ns.cloudlfare.com
```

## Create a Cloudflare account and add a domain
If you donâ€™t have a Cloudflare account create one. And from â€˜add siteâ€™ add your domain in Cloudflare. #Freebie

## Update Cloudflare DNS
Now you need to update your domainâ€™s DNS from Cloudflareâ€™s DNS Panel. For every entry, click on â€˜Add recordâ€™, Select Type â€˜Aâ€™, enter the @ if you want to use your root domain (e.g example.co.uk) in the â€˜Nameâ€™ field, and in the â€˜IPv4 addressâ€™ field you need to add the below IP's. These IPâ€™s are availible in GitHubâ€™s documentation

```
185.199.108.153

185.199.109.153

185.199.110.153

185.199.111.153
```

## Configure GitHub

Go to your Github Repository and from the repository settings, go to Github Pages and there you will have an option for adding a custom domain enter the domain used in the DNS Records above (e.g example.co.uk). Once your domain has been added
