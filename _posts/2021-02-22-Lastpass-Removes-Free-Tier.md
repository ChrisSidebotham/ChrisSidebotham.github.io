Good password management is critical for protecting your personal and business identity from breaches and harmful attacks. LastPass offered unlimited access to passwords from both desktop and mobile applications with a very smooth user experience for no charge. Today that changes!

LogMeIn the parent company of LastPass have announced that from the 16th March, users will have to choose a preferred platform as LastPass will lock the vault on the other devices. While some of you may think 'Well thats okay, I only need to use one device at a time', unfortunately, LogMeIn has seen this coming and only allows you to swap between devices three times, after that you will be required to take out a subscription to LastPass' paid tier in order to access your passwords on both platforms. 

Reading into LastPass' new rules, mobile devices includes (but not limited to) the following: 
- IOS
- IPadOS
- WatchOS
- Android 
- WearOS

Whereas the Desktop devices include: 
- Windows 
- Linux
- MacOS

Yes! That does also include your Surface Pro tablet, Windows IoT and the LastPass Browser Extension. 

As well as removing the access to your passwords from multiple devices, LastPass has also announced it's email support service will discontinue for non-paying customers, leaving only the support centre documents should you have an issue. So with all this in mind LastPass has seemed to follow suit with it's competitors such as Dashlane, NordPass and Sticky Password. 

If you choose to change password managers apposed to sticking with a singular device, remember LastPass does include a csv export feature from the application which you can use to import into other password managers (don't forget to delete the csv for your storage afterwards!) and you should always close you account down https://lastpass.com/delete_account.php if you are no longer using the app. 

Stay safe and keep secure!
