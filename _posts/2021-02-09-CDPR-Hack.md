It's safe to say CD Projekt Red has had a pretty bad year. Cyberpunk 2077 has fallen foul to hundreds of bugs and glitches, of which CDPR announced would be addressed over the coming months. However, CD Projekt Red's bad year - just got worse... 

Today CD Projekt Red announced it had been a victim of an extensive ransom attack. The ransom amount has not been released and CD Projekt Red has turned all evidence over to the authorities with a plan to mitigate the damage caused.

The Hackers have claimed to have dumped documentation relating to accounting, HR, legal and investor relations. Along with the source code for Cyberpunk 2077, Witcher 3, Gwent and the unreleased version of Witcher 3. The hackers threaten the dumped material will be leaked online if CD Projekt Red does not meet the ransom within 48 hours. 

The full response from CD Projekt Red was released this morning
